                <h2>Kaoruko Waguri</h2>
                <p>
                    Kaoruko is described as a pretty and petite young girl with wavy, hip length dark hair secured with a black colored headband and dark colored eyes.

                Kaoruko is a kind, sweet girl who loves eating. She doesn't judge the people she meets by their appearances, rather by their actions. This is noted by Rintaro during their encounter. After she starts dating with Rintaro, we are able to see her getting embarrassed, flustered, and nervous.

                <h2>Rintaro Tsumugi</h2>
                <p>
                    Rintaro is a tall man with spiky blonde hair, originally black, thin eyes, and a perpetually weary expression. He wears earrings and has brown eyes.

                <div class="pageNumber">4</div>
                <p>
                    Not only is he tall, but his imposing appearance often made people hesitant to approach him. Many even avoided him and gave him judgmental looks as part of their daily routine. Rintaro is initially introduced as a quiet individual, who is cautious and self-concious of his actions.
